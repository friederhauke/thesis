\subsection{Calculation of the potential}

The calculation begins with the reduction of the roof area according to the building age class as described in chapter \ref{sec:roofarea}. If the roof surface is a flat roof ($tilt < 8 ^\circ$) the modules cannot directly mounted of the roof surface. To bring the modules in an optimal tilt angle they are mounted on a mounting system of the roof. Because they are tilted they might shadow the neighboring modules, therefore a certain distance between the modules is necessary as shown in Figure \ref{fig:flatroof}. The distance has to be $c=2.75$ times longer then the width of the ground of the module $w$.

Furthermore the global irradiance has to be picked from the look-up table. According to Solar Atlas Berlin \citen{solaratlas} areas with a global irradiance less than $905 Wh/m^2$ have to be neglected. Also surface are neglected which have a smaller area then $5m^2$. It is assumed that it is economically not worth the mount modules on such a small roof. The actual calculation of the potential highly depends on the type of module. This will be explained in the following sub sections.
