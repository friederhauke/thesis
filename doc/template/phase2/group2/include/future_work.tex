\subsection{Future Work}
%TODO: things which may be implemented to improve the results. describe possible solutions to fix the  ``weak spots'' which we pointed %out in the conclusion.

Further investigations to improve the calculation model can lead to better results. Instead of an Lod 2 geometry a higher level of detail as Lod 3 can be used, which describes the geometry of the roofs in more detail. To avoid the neglection of too small roof surfaces due to wrong surface separations, neighboring roof surfaces with equal inclination and orientation should be merged in future.\\
In addition a high order shadow model, which considers partly shadowing of a roof surfaces due to other buildings and shadowing due to additional roof structures. Until now the shadow model is not capable of reducing the global irradiation, but neglects the whole building. The new model should be able to deal with this reduction due to partly shadowed roof surfaces.
