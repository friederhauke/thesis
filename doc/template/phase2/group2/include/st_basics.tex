\subsection{Fundamentals of Solar thermal systems}

Solar thermal collectors are devices, which transform radiation emitted by sun into heat. Basically, a collector consists of a box with a black glazed cover, containing a pipe, which uses all the space in the box. The radiation is adsorbed by the black glazing and heats up a fluid, such as water or oil, which runs through the pipe equipped in the  collector. The heated fluid can then be stored in insulated tanks, if it cannot be used directly.    In general solar collectors are used for use water in a household or for heating.\citen{Kalogirou}

basically, the efficiency of a solar thermal collector depends on the absorption of the glazing, the input fluid temperature , the average air temperature as well as the solar radiation of the region.
